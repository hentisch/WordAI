# WordAI
A game made for the October repl.it game Jam in one which one tries to guess a word based on which words an "AI" algorithm (word embeddings) finds most similar to those words.

# Installation
Either clone this repo onto your computer, or simply [play the game on repl.it](https://replit.com/@hentisch/Word-AI?v=1)

NOTE: This game was made in a week for a game jam when I was learning how to code. I published it here just becuase it is a cool project, but just make sure not to take the code published here too seriously.
